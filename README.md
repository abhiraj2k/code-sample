# Code Sample

This is a code sample from my project which I wrote while working on an Open Source component Library called [Lightvue](https://lightvue.org/).
It is a fully customizable and responsive drawer.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
